    <h1>Who i am</h1>
    <p>
      Hey there! When I'm not glued to my laptop, you'll find me soaking up the joy of life. Whether it's diving into
      code or making a splash in the pool (yes, I'm a swimmer!), my love for football keeps me on my toes. Oh, and did I
      mention I'm a bit of a chef in the making? Cooking up new recipes is my kind of adventure. And when the day winds
      down, you might catch me in a heated video game battle. Let's keep it fun and techy!</p>
